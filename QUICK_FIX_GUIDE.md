# ⚡ Quick Fix Guide - Get Running in 3 Steps

## 🎯 Your Current Error

```
Error: SASL: SCRAM-SERVER-FIRST-MESSAGE: client password must be a string
```

**Cause:** The `.env` file has a placeholder password instead of your actual PostgreSQL password.

---

## 🔧 Fix in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Update Password (30 seconds)

Open `.env` file and find line 13:

```env
DB_PASSWORD=your_password_here
```

Replace with your actual PostgreSQL password:

```env
DB_PASSWORD=YourActualPassword123
```

**💡 Tip:** This is the password you entered when you ran `createdb sufi_essences -U postgres`

---

### Step 2: Initialize Database (1 minute)

```bash
npm run db:init
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🚀 Starting database initialization...
1️⃣  Initializing database connection...
✓ Database connection successful
2️⃣  Creating database schema...
✓ Schema created successfully
3️⃣  Seeding database with sample data...
✓ Database seeded successfully
✅ Database initialization complete!
```

---

### Step 3: Start Application (30 seconds)

```bash
npm run dev:all
```

This starts both:
- Backend API on `http://localhost:5000`
- Frontend on `http://localhost:5173`

**Expected Output:**
```
✓ Database connection initialized
✓ Server running on http://localhost:5000
✓ Environment: development

VITE ready in 1234 ms
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

## ✅ Success Checklist

- [ ] Updated `DB_PASSWORD` in `.env`
- [ ] Ran `npm run db:init` successfully
- [ ] Backend started without errors
- [ ] Frontend opened in browser
- [ ] No console errors (or ready to fix them)

## 🐛 If You See React Errors

Once the app is running, you might see console warnings like:

1. **"Maximum update depth exceeded"**
   - This is a React infinite loop
   - I'll help you fix it once the app is running

2. **"Cannot update component while rendering"**
   - This is a setState timing issue
   - I'll help you fix it once the app is running

3. **Passive event listener warnings**
   - These are performance warnings
   - I'll help you fix them once the app is running

**Don't worry about these yet - let's get the app running first!**
