## ✅ The Fix is Ready!

Your `netlify.toml` has been **fixed and pushed to GitHub**.

The TOML syntax error has been resolved. Now you need to trigger a new deployment on Netlify.

## 🎯 Quick Steps to Redeploy

### Step 1: Go to Netlify Dashboard
```
https://netlify.com
→ Sign In
→ Select your site
```

### Step 2: Go to Deploys
```
Left Sidebar → "Deploys"
```

### Step 3: Trigger New Deploy
```
Click "Trigger deploy" button
Select "Deploy site"
```

### Step 4: Wait for Build
```
Watch the build progress
Should take 2-3 minutes
```

### Step 5: Check Result
```
✅ If successful: Your site is live!
❌ If failed: Check the build logs
```

---

## 📊 What Was Fixed

### The Problem
```
netlify.toml had duplicate sections:
- [dev] appeared twice
- [functions] appeared twice
- [context.*] appeared multiple times

This caused: "Failed to parse configuration"
```

### The Solution
```
Removed all duplicates
Kept only one instance of each section
File is now clean and valid
```

---

## ✅ Verification

After deployment, verify:

```bash
# Test your site loads
https://your-site.netlify.app

# Test API health
curl https://your-site.netlify.app/api/health

# Test categories
curl https://your-site.netlify.app/api/categories
```

---

## 🆘 If Build Still Fails

### Check Build Logs
```
Netlify Dashboard → Deploys → Latest Deploy
Click on the deploy to see logs
Look for error messages
```

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "DATABASE_URL not found"
```
Solution: Add in Netlify Site Settings → Environment
```

**Issue**: "Function timeout"
```
Solution: Already set to 30s in netlify.toml
```

**Issue**: "CORS errors"
```
Solution: Already configured in netlify.toml
```
