# âœ… Netlify Configuration Fixed

## Problem
Netlify deployment failed with error:
```
Failed to parse configuration
```

The `netlify.toml` file had **duplicate sections** causing TOML syntax errors:
- Duplicate `[dev]` sections
- Duplicate `[functions]` sections  
- Duplicate `[context.*]` sections

---

## Solution Applied

### What Was Fixed
1. **Removed all duplicate sections** from `netlify.toml`
2. **Kept only one instance** of each configuration section
3. **Validated TOML syntax** - file is now clean and valid

### Changes Made
```
BEFORE: 134 lines (with duplicates)
AFTER:  86 lines (clean and valid)

Removed:
- Duplicate [dev] section
- Duplicate [functions] section
- Duplicate [context.production.environment]
- Duplicate [context.deploy-preview.environment]
- Duplicate [context.branch-deploy.environment]
- Duplicate [build.processing.*] sections
```

## Current netlify.toml Structure

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm ci && npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
  CI = "true"
  VITE_APP_ENV = "production"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/api/:splat"
  status = 200

[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    (security headers...)

[dev]
  command = "npm run dev"
  port = 5173

[functions]
  directory = "netlify/functions"
  node_bundler = "esbuild"
  timeout = 30
  memory = 1024

[context.production.environment]
  VITE_APP_ENV = "production"
  NODE_ENV = "production"

[context.deploy-preview.environment]
  VITE_APP_ENV = "staging"

[context.branch-deploy.environment]
  VITE_APP_ENV = "development"
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Trigger New Deployment
```
Go to Netlify Dashboard
â†’ Deploys
â†’ Trigger deploy
â†’ Deploy site
```

### 2. Monitor Build
```
Watch the build logs
Should complete in 2-3 minutes
```

### 3. Verify Deployment
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-site.netlify.app/api/health

# Test API
curl https://your-site.netlify.app/api/categories
```

### 4. Check for Errors
```
If build still fails:
1. Check Netlify build logs
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Ensure DATABASE_URL is correct
```
